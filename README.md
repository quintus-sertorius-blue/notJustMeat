## How to Setup

Pre-requisites: Ruby and Jekyll

git clone https://github.com/bitstein/justmeat.co.git
cd justmeat.co
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can then open the website in your browser at `localhost:4000`.

## How to Deploy

This repo comes with a deploy script for AWS S3 using the `awscli` which can be installed with `pip install awscli`. If you use Cloudflare, rename `bin/purge_cache.example` to `bin/purge_cache`. Change the variables to your Cloudflare credentials. If you don't remove `bin/purge_cache` from `bin/deploy`. Finally, use `chmod +x bin/purge_cache` to make it executable.
